# Deduplicating Utils & Medias Bundle

## A bundle of C tools to deduplicate your code!

Deduplicating Utils & Medias Bundle (or dumb) is a group of source files and header. You can use it in your project to do common stuff like "read a file" or "print with color in terminal"...

The code in this bundle works with Linux (tested on Fedora) and MacOS (Latest version). It's pretty common C, not really intresting to watch I think...

I think that everybody need a "dumb" lib-like in his system!

## How to use it

- You can copy the sources and headers in your project
- You can built it as a lib and use compiler flags to remove unused code
- You can copy the sources content and past it in your code!
